# My first Website.
I did it for myself to be my CV, I used HTML, CSS, Javascript and a Thinkful Template that I found :)
I wish that you apreciate it.



### Credits: Thinkful TPM Portfolio Template
This portfolio template was created from existing CV and Portfolio templates, as an example of the types of static pages that students can build using basic HTML and CSS skills taught as part of the practical technology portion of Thinkful's Technical Project Management program.
